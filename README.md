# The PROC Language

A Haskell implementation of the PROC language specification from the book *Essentials of Programming Languages*, 3rd edition, by Friedman and Wand. This is only intended as a study project and borrows most of its code from [my implementation of the LET language](https://github.com/groscoe/friedman-wand-let-language). A reference implementation in Racket is available on [Github](https://github.com/mwand/eopl3).
